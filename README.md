# Tech Test for Software Engineer II Role - Civic Tech Practice

This is a tech test for use in Software Engineer II recruiting for BlueLabs Analytics' Civic Tech practice. 

## Information for Candidates

Thank you for applying for the Software Engineer II Role for Bluelabs Analytics' civic tech practice. This test will be shared with you approximately 36 hours before your scheduled technical screen with the Hiring Manager. You may choose to either complete the test on your own schedule (take home) or over zoom during the technical screen (whiteboard style) - if you would like to complete this test during the technical screen please make sure to inform our recruiting team so we can schedule sufficient time for the technical interview. 

This test is designed to validate for the following skills and practices:

* basic git knowledge
* problem solving and reasoning
* thoughtful application of existing skills 
* ability to read and understand unfamiliar code <i>well enough</i>
* communication skills (written or verbal depending on chosen test format)
* cleanliness and modularity

What this is **not** designed to test:

* knowledge of academic CS concepts
* memorization of exact syntax

<b>If you would normally look something up, it's okay to say or comment "this is where I would look XYZ up"!</b>

The test will be reviewed by two reviewers using the rubric below.  

## Special notes for take-home candidates

Our expectation is that you should spend between 1-2 hours on this. If it takes you much longer than 1-2 hours to complete the two tasks detailed in the instructions _and_ write up a detailed narrative about your process, you may want to reconsider whether this is a position you are interested in pursuing.

## Special notes for whiteboard candidates

Please make sure you are ready to interact with github <i>ahead</i> of the technical screen - i.e. make sure your ssh keys are set up, you have the repository cloned locally, you have an ide installed, etc. Remember: that your thought process is as important as the code you produce, so our expectation is that you will verbally narrativize your decisions as you work through the test. If you are more comfortable with written communication, you may prefer to complete this as a take-home.

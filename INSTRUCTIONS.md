# Instructions

Today is your first day of work at a tee shirt factory. You are given access to a repository called `inventory_manager` containing a large csv file called inventory.csv and a bash script called `show_stock.sh`. 

1. Translate `show_stock.sh` into a python module (`python_inventory_tools/show_stock.py`) designed to be used in a future package for inventory management. 

2. Create a new module (`python_inventory_tools/reduce_price.py`) designed to automatically reduce the wholesale price by 20% of any color and style of tee shirt that has historically not sold at least 60% of its inventory within 60 days. 

3. Create a README file with all the necessary information to locally test and run these two modules. 

## Tips:

* While you are welcome to use the internet, this is not designed to test your memory of python syntax or your googling skills. Rather than spend time looking up the exact syntax, feel free to make an educated guess and leave a comment explaining how you would go about finding guidance in the real world. 
* When in doubt use your best judgement - and leave a comment explaining why you made the decisions you made. 
* We are more interested in sound logic, a high degree of readability, and good design decisions than running code.

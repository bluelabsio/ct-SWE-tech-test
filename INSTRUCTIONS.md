# Instructions

Today is your first day of work at a tee shirt factory. You are given access to a repository called `inventory_manager` containing a large csv file called inventory.csv and a bash script called `reduce_price.sh`. 

1. Translate `reduce_price.sh` into a python module designed to be used in a future package for inventory management. 

2. Create a new module designed to automatically reduce the wholesale price of any color of tee shirt that has not sold at least 60% of its existing inventory within 60 days. 

3. Create a README file with all the necessarry information to locally test and run these two modules.
